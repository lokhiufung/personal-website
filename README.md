# Personal Website
This is Fisher Lok's personal website! Thanks for [hqasmei's repo](https://github.com/hqasmei/tailwindcss-and-nextjs-portfolio/tree/final) to give me a starting point for my website! This website is modified from her repo.

## Getting Started
Run the development server 
```bash
# npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
