# Project Cantonese

## Background
This is the biggest work I have been doing in IMIMR. Our company has been working on building a virtual assistant which is capable of undestanding cantonese. (Almost everyone speaks canotonese in Hong Kong)

Cantonese is a language within the Chinese branch of the Sino-Tibetan languages originating from the city og Guangzhou (also known as Canton) and its surrounding area in Southeastern China... if you want to know more about the background or history of cantonese, please go with the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantonese). I just copy from that~
