description: 'We know that there are 2 learning systems. But why do we need 2 separate learning systems? In this article, we will explain the role of the hippocampus to the slow integration of new experiences through replay. This provides insight for us to tackle the problem we called ‘catastrophic forgetting’ in training an artificial neural network. The quick adaption and slow integration of new experiences mechanism suggested in CLS may also provide insights on designing the architectures of an intelligent agent.'
