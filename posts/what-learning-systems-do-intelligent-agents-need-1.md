description: 'Memory is the data or information retrieved when an intelligent agent needs it. The ability to retrieve and store memory is one of the features of intelligent agents. With the theory of Complementary Learning Systems (CLS), an intelligent agent implements 2 learning systemsâ€” one in the neocortex for slow learning, one in the hippocampus for fast learning. Learning in a deep artificial neural network can be considered as slow learning in the neocortex. Training a deep neural network is data-inefficient, even though a deep neural network is powerful. A Release from DeepMind reviewed CLS and proposed that there may be insight from this theory to address this problem.'
