<!-- I was an AI Application Developer in [IMIMR Systems Limited](https://www.imimr.biz). I completed my bachelor degree in Mathematics in the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk). I build voice chatbot in IMIMR, and my area of work includes deep learning models in automatic speech recognition, text to speech, question and answering. I research and run experiments everyday as my daily working routine. I mainly focus on models for cantonese (main language in Hong Kong).

Personally, I am also interested in interactive AI and it's related algorithms (e.g algorithms in deep reinforcement learning). I believe that the next generation of AI should be more interactive and adaptive. (Exploring the environment by AI itself instead of preparing large scale super expensive training dataset). I am interested in building a DevOp for such interactive AI.

I am also a [Korfball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnNSU4kbVvI) and basketball player :)
